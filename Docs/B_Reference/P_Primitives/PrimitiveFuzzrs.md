# Primitive Fuzzrs
QuickFuzzr includes built-in Fuzzrs for all common primitive types.
These cover the usual suspects: numbers, booleans, characters, strings, dates, times, ...  
All with sensible defaults and range-based overloads.
They form the foundation on which more complex Fuzzrs are composed, and are used automatically when generating object properties.

All range-based numeric fuzzrs follow .NET conventions: the lower bound is inclusive and the upper bound is exclusive, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

> *All primitive Fuzzrs automatically drive object property generation.
> Nullable and non-nullable variants are both supported.
> Each Fuzzr also supports `.Nullable(...)` / `.NullableRef(...)` as appropriate.*
