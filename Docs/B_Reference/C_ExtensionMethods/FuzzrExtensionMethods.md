# Fuzzr Extension Methods
QuickFuzzr provides a collection of extension methods that enhance the expressiveness and composability of `FuzzrOf<T>`.
These methods act as modifiers, they wrap existing fuzzrs to alter behavior, add constraints,
or chain side-effects without changing the underlying LINQ-based model.
